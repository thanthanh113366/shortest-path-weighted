# Shortest Path on Weighted Polyhedral Surfaces

A C++ library for computing epsilon-approximate shortest paths on polyhedral surfaces using Half-Edge data structure.

## 📋 Overview

This project implements a computational geometry library focused on finding approximate shortest paths on 3D polyhedral surfaces. It uses the Half-Edge data structure for efficient representation and traversal of polyhedral meshes.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Data Structures
- **HE_Vertex**: Vertices with 3D coordinates
- **HE_Face**: Triangular faces with weights
- **HE_HalfEdge**: Directed edges forming the mesh topology

### Key Features
- ✅ OFF file format loader with face weights
- ✅ Half-Edge data structure implementation
- ✅ Paper-compliant polyhedron validation
- ✅ Support for both closed and open meshes
- ⚠️ Shortest path algorithm (in development)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++11 support
- Make or CMake (optional)

### Building
```bash
# Compile the test application
g++ -o test_app test.cpp ShortestPathLib.cpp -std=c++14

# Run the test
./test_app
```

### Input Format

**Paper Requirements (Aleksandrov et al.):**
- Simple polyhedron (no self-intersections)
- Triangular faces only
- Positive face weights w_i > 0
- Non-degenerate geometry
- **Both closed and open meshes supported**

**Extended OFF Format:**
```
OFF
<num_vertices> <num_faces> <num_edges>
<vertex_coordinates>
<face_definitions_with_weights>
```

**Face Definition:**
```
3 v1 v2 v3 weight
```

**Example:**
```
OFF
8 12 0
1 1 -1
1 -1 -1
...
3 0 1 2 1.0    # Triangle with vertices 0,1,2 and weight 1.0
3 0 2 3 1.2    # Triangle with vertices 0,2,3 and weight 1.2
...
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Triangular faces verification
- ✅ Positive weights checking  
- ✅ Geometric degeneracy detection
- ✅ Minimum angle computation
- ✅ Vertex height calculation (h_v)
